algorithm
--------
i understand algorithm is about :sort ,search,heap,queqe,stack,link list,graph,my view is form
yanweimin,i can remember sort is very importtant ,sort algorithm has so many types:bubble sort,
bucket sort,heap sort ,iterate sort,or so on, i canot remember ,bubble sort 's principle is very simple,in ervery iteration,you need  to make the corresponding element to correct position.if there is 1,3,4,2,5'
for 5>2,you left position ,for 2<4,2 will be in 4  origin postion ,for 2<3,2 will  be in 3's position ,for 
2>1, i will go 1,i 's left position has no number .first sort is ok!!!!!iin algorithm ,i dislike complixity
analysis.for i feel that i cannot grasp math and logic in these algorithm.i believe 5,4,3,2,1 is the 
shit  case of bubble sort.this is o(n*n)! i remember there is another and usual sort algorithm............

My advice to self-learners is: never engage in "cargo-cult programming". This means: do not touch or reuse code that you do not understand. Force yourself to understand. If you lack the time, write it down and follow up later

python class self ,best understand is  that,if a instance was created ,self

define a instance ,you can add a instance attribute,for axample:
class A:
    def __init__(self,bi,lu):
        self.author=bi
        self.title=lu
you can use a=A(67,78),YOU CAN USE a.io='yangmingishandsome'

python interpreter run  a .py file located in disk and ask os to allocate space in
memory to run the program.before compiling,there is a paser ,it will parser grammar 
to syntax tree,comiple the tree to bytecode.there  are more discuss,in compile,that is
,.py------>.pyc that is,in fact,import sector will convert to .pyc .for example.a.by 
include import b(b.py),that is ,b.py-------b.pyc.but a will not compile.but in the runtime a.py will be compile to .pyc in memory.........but when you exit ,it will
delete .pyc file..

form now,i feel that python all kinds of methods implemented by class method
aalso,class method main include magical method,this is main method to implement

some subclass ,just  a guess ,such as ,collection,object .......balbala.about class method ,there is a mechinism called fall back to ,it is, when you invoke a method ,the method doesnot exist ,it will invoke another method.

i can feel that python interpreter actions when you run a script or a program ,a=3,allocate memory
??????????????????????????????????????????????a=Classexample(6,7,8).same ,allocate for the instance
,when you can use len(a)(the class implement __len()__ mwthod ),the interpreter see what a is ???
fuck it is a class (i doubt there it activate a mechinism that check  the type object,for instance,
the checked result is string ,it will understnd string class have implemented __len__ method,it will
invoke it,a.__len__() and the return value.) ,it will check if the class include a __len__() method,
if it  include,it will  get the value.if not,it will  give callback error or say it is exception!!!!

i doubt all python object implemented by class
phd sai that python object in python shell(or interpreter ) life circle
is exit python shell.but in function ,wehn function end,the object end ,but 
also observe reference count.another info a=[1,23,4,5],when i use a[3]=1,i only in-place (origin list position) change list rather than create a list,but also
spicial situation.you must notice.from my opinion,a=[1,2,3,4,5,6].you can understand that
list is common mutable consequnce,but string and tuple ,string is immutable,what is immutable,
immutable is a[3] if can change origin consequnce value. i can undestand ,when you a=a+b ,id(a) donot equal 
origin id(a),but you use a+=[2],id(a) is oriign value.this is same in literaly.you can understand that in-place 
as same position but new is not at same position.__iadd__ is the former ,by visrce.

* http://www.worldtrendsresearch.com/major-trends.php

Here is a general list of ideas that I'd like to pick 2 to 3 from the topics to create a project that is mashing them up in a Ruby On Rails project. It's important to choose only key features of each topic and merge them into one idea.

I don't see the problem that people seem to have according to trends, so I cannot solve it.

Can you please help me with that? I'm searching for a project idea.

server's function do deal with the data and return data
to customer,from send data view,i understand what style to
be used to send data ,it related to network ,i can go on  abstarct transmit data(via internet ,forward data to corresponding function),encript data,deal data,imho ,coreesonding network and algorithm,languge.of course ,i find that you must note there is data store problem.

via implement a __getitem__ and __len__ method,i can implent a sequence (or list )
most method,susch as len ,a[3],balabalbala......but i cannot change the sequece

function,implecitly  invoke the __getitem__ method,other functions seem to be same!!!you must know python interpreter invoke this spicial methos,interpreter is 
python version......i want to say that __repr__ and __str__ 's effect is same .but we advise you use __repr__method
imho,sequence is somthings such as animal include pepole

you can a=class(),a.classlevel to get value.you can refer to 
https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/
.if you can in class to implement __getitem__ method,you will a[]
and result loop and reversed .so on,you can finish iterable  function such as

encode and decode
-------
about decode and encode ,the is connetction about convert byte to objetc that human can understand.
in unicode culture ,there is a way that convert charater,it is automatic unite of  a languge, to numbers
numbers converts to bit that was storaged in computer.from now my view,unicode define a large number to
corresponding alll kinds of charater.simple to say.unicode is like a table,you can map number to charater
in the world.about ascii,i want to say if i send you 65,you understand i send a A to you.from now,byte ,asingle
byte cannot slove to represent all kinds of symbol.i need to  understand python code how to convert machnie code.
-----
python
-----
from yangming's view ,when you use a=5 or b='yangmingishandosmor',when you run python
python will allocate memory according to size,besides,'yangmingishandsome' is convert to

is the gcc???

about pep8 ,imho,you ned tool to format and read more  about 
matrerail

PYTHON's unicode decode and encode is a pile of shit.
about a=b a and b all refer to same object
about c=a[2:3],c is a new list.from now, i think only a=b,a is b
all other situations,not same object,may values is same

----
session and session id
-----
i understand session is paharase that  start client send request to server and server send 
reply data to client between the two pharase.from my view,i think ,ssesion is to slove 
the problem that how to slove http stateless  problem ,thatis,again http request ,you need to
write username and userpassword,but ssession id slove the problem,
a session id a connection.session is a data structure that 
save your username and password(hassed).besides,you can save another things in
session,session connect mode is the following:user use username and
 password to login in web server if authenticated,server make a session
datastructure that includes your username and your password and allocate
a session id to the session and keep the session id in cookie and
send it to client allong with http/s response,when client go on another request,
it will send request to server with session id.
when server receive the session id .server will to check the session id if exsit
and do responding action .if exist ,go on .or server will request client
to login.  but there is another view,session a period that between user login in and 
user login out.also session id and ssesion content is dictionary,eg,6374838834:{'username':yangming,
'password':xxxxxxxx(hashed)},about the form of session saved in server file system
or database or cache system.more things ,when more request were made ,you need
to send http request with session id in http body or head argments or cookie or usrl argument!!!
what i want to ask is the connection between cookie and http. another view,store too many data
in cilent-side will increse your traffic.i can use facebook  as example,when you first
login to server ,server check your passwod and username.if authenticated,fb will make 
ssession id and  return your main page,and you continue request another link in your
page ,you donot need authenticate ,in the hood,the browser will use the -styile link
http://en.mail.qq.com/cgi-bin/readmail?sid=YkCUuyVilYYnMRxE,

3e281772..but you need note that the session id is encrypted in cooike sent to server,but when you in chrome ,you can read uncrypted sseion id.....i want to know
when you click  a link in fb ,who make your url's sid ,who encrypt it?????more,when
clear your browser  data you will must  login again!!!!now i can undestand the connection between period and  ssession ,because after logining,your cookie will always
be invoked!!!!!!when you login out ,your sseion id can not be used!!!

 depath a url  to scratch to get all kinds of arguments.for example
 the url is http://wwww.goo.com/?queryyangming=234&ui=colorful
 .the server will get yangming and ui .after this,this argumewnts will be pass to corresponding function to deal with and get return value .
 after it,server return value send to client,and client do corresponding actions.imho,json in this course was used frequently

Secret #6: Redirect Your Attention
When you run out of things to say, you can use “focus changer”. Focus changer is a question you ask yourself on paper that requires you to comment on something you’ve just written. It keeps you moving, and helps you focus on the yet unexplored parts of a situation.

Examples of focus changers include:

What was I thinking here?
How else can I say that?
Wha

Prompt Your Thinking
Prompts are Freewriting exercise. When doing this exercise, you begin the Freewriting session with a pre-determined prompt.

Prompts are open-ended phrases to warm you up and to send your mind into unanticipated directions.

Prompts allow you to find many hidden jewels that you wouldn’t otherwise discover.

Some examples of prompts include:

The best part of my workday is…
Yesterday I saw a curious thing…
If I didn’t have to work, I’d…
I threw a stone and it landed…
I remember….
I’d love to learn about…
If I did the opposite of everything I normally do, my day would look like this…
I love…
I hate…
I should do more…
You know what I’d like to do again?
If I were guaranteed success, the project I’d take on would be…
The very generic ones can work wonders:

The storm
It was getting dark…
The birds were singing…
I opened the door…
Three days from now…
Prompts are somewhat similar to one of my long-time favorite techniques – question answered on paper. Basically, you write a question, and then start answering it. That’s it. It’s like querying your mind.

When you make the question very open-ended, you are not looking for specific answers, and it’s a prompt. The result will be a surprise. On the other hand, when the question is very specific, so will be the answers.
