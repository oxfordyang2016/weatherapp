When you go with a thought, 
you assume that the thought is true, 
and you can take a series of logical steps.
 Just like this: If A is true, 
 that means B is true. And if B is true, that means C is true. And if C is true,

why markdown does not work in web page paster

Secret #6: Redirect Your Attention
When you run out of things to say, you can use “focus changer”. Focus changer is a question you ask yourself on paper that requires you to comment on something you’ve just written. It keeps you moving, and helps you focus on the yet unexplored parts of a situation.

Examples of focus changers include:

What was I thinking here?
How else can I say that?
Wha


```
```
        def helloworld(a,b):
            print 'hello wolrd'
        if __main__=='hello':

Prompt Your Thinking
Prompts are Freewriting exercise. When doing this exercise, you begin the Freewriting session with a pre-determined prompt.

Prompts are open-ended phrases to warm you up and to send your mind into unanticipated directions.

Prompts allow you to find many hidden jewels that you wouldn’t otherwise discover.

Some examples of prompts include:

The best part of my workday is…
Yesterday I saw a curious thing…
If I didn’t have to work, I’d…
I threw a stone and it landed…
I remember….
I’d love to learn about…
If I did the opposite of everything I normally do, my day would look like this…
I love…
I hate…
I should do more…
You know what I’d like to do again?
If I were guaranteed success, the project I’d take on would be…
The very generic ones can work wonders:

The storm
It was getting dark…
The birds were singing…
I opened the door…
Three days from now…
Prompts are somewhat similar to one of my long-time favorite techniques – question answered on paper. Basically, you write a question, and then start answering it. That’s it. It’s like querying your mind.

When you make the question very open-ended, you are not looking for specific answers, and it’s a prompt. The result will be a surprise. On the other hand, when the question is very specific, so will be the answers.

i belive that hte feeling i wrete is a base to influence my judgement

but i feel it is bullshit


all i have wittren up to this point about  how to use markdown 
is bullshit,the truth is that markdown is a luanguge  for writting
but a proamming language 
i find that my problem is not how to slobe the problem 
,my probelem is to understand problem  and understand what sloution 
says .it is key to slove most problems i faces now.imho,i need to up my english ability and understanding linux basic
